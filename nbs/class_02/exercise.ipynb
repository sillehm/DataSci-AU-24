    "1. Create a folder called `group-x` within `nbs/class_02`, `cd` into it and work within that today\n",
    "2. Choose an outcome variable for a regression problem. On the basis of this, define **which of the evaluation metrics** could be suitable. Evaluation metrics can be computed using scikit-learn: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/model_evaluation.html#regression-metrics \n",
    "3. (a) If you are in the bike sharing group, split your dataset into a training/validation/test set using later time points as validation/test set. Validation and test set should be 15% of your data each. (b) If you are in the personality group, using sklearn's `train_test_split` function, create a 70/15/15 random split of your data.\n",
    "    - Remember to set a seed (`random_state`) when you do so. Let's all use the same (the classic `random_state=42`)\n",
    "    - Save these datasets as separate csv files in a subfolder called `data`\n",
    "4. Look at your outcome and predictors: do you want to transform them in any way?\n",
    "5. Estimate the performance of a dummy baseline (i.e., the mean model) on all splits\n",
    "6. Now look at your predictors: do they need any preprocessing? Any transformations? Removal of \"bad\" data points?\n",
    "7. Fit the other models using KKN (sklearn's `KNeighborsRegressor`: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.neighbors.KNeighborsRegressor.html) and linear models (`LinearRegressor`: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression.html). Save the fitted model object (with a meaningful name) using `pickle` (https://scikit-learn.org/stable/model_persistence.html) in a subfolder called `model`.\n",
    "8. Once you are done, evaluate all models on both the training and the validation set and visualize the scores\n"
